If you don\u0027t request this permission, you will not receive the broadcast at that time. Though holding this permission does not have any security implications, it can have a negative impact on the user experience by increasing the amount of time it takes the system to start and allowing applications to have themselves running without the user being aware of them. As such, you must explicitly declare your use of this facility to make that visible to the user.",
        "android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE": "Allows an application to write to external storage. Note: If both your minSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion values are set to 3 or lower, the system implicitly grants your app this permission. If you don\u0027t need this permission, be sure your targetSdkVersion is 4 or higher. Starting in API level 19, this permission is not required to read\/write files in your application-specific directories returned by getExternalFilesDir(String) and getExternalCacheDir().",

All root apps should from now on declare this permission in their AndroidManifest.xml. Due to changes in Android 5.0 Lollipop, this permission has been deprecated and is completely ignored from SuperSU v2.30 onwards. If this permission is not present, SuperSU will present a warning in its superuser request popup (this is configurable in SuperSU settings). At the time of this writing this permission is not enforced, but it is expected that sometime in the future it will be, and apps requesting root that do not have this permission set will be silently denied. If this permission is declared, the user will be able to see in the app permissions list that the app requests superuser access."
